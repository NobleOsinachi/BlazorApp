**Disclaimer:**

This app is created solely for educational purposes and to demonstrate the capabilities of Blazor and CELO's cUSD token. The app does not provide actual pizza delivery services or handle real financial transactions. Please do not use real CELO tokens for payments within this app.

**Note:**

Blazor is a versatile and powerful framework for building web applications using C# and .NET. To make this app functional with real delivery services and payments, additional integration with actual pizza delivery APIs and a secure payment gateway would be necessary. This project serves as a learning exercise to explore Blazor's capabilities and its potential integration with blockchain-based payment systems.
